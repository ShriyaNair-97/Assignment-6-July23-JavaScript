        <h5>Question 1</h5>
      <p> Jeff and Todd are trying to compare their BMI (body mass index) which is calculated using the formula-: BMI= mass(kg)/height(m)^2 = mass/(height*height)<br>
1.	Store Jeff and Todd’s height in variables<br>
2.	Calculate both their BMIs<br>
3.	Create a boolean variable containing information on whether Jeff has higher BMI than John<br>
4.	Print a string to console containing the variable from step 3 (Something like “is Jeff’s BMI higher than Todd’s true?”) <br>
      </p>
      <h5>Question 2</h5>
      <p>Heath and Zane are both playing basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, Heath’s team scored 89, 120 and 103 points while Zane’s team scored 116. 94 and 123 points.<br>
        1.	Calculate the average score for each team<br>
        2.	Decide which team wins in average (highest average score) and print the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the output.<br>
        3.	Then change the scores to show different winners. Don’t forget to consider that there might be a draw (the same average score)<br>
        4.	EXTRA: Mariah also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average value to the console. HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision.<br>
